TESTS
=====

BASEPLAN TESTS
    * Create a single phase recurring plan
        - check for creation event (timing?)
        - check for no termination event
        - check pricing (different currencies)
        - check BDC (subscription, account, timezone)
    * Create a single phase fixed length plan 
        - check for creation event (timing - different request dates)
        - check for termination event (timing - different lengths?)
        - check price (fixed vs recurring)
    * Create a two phase event use a fixed price and a recurring price
        - check for phase change (timing)
        - check prices change
    * Create a multi-phase plan 
        - check for phase events
        - check price changes
    * Create multiple base plans in a single bundle - should fail
    
    * Change base plan once
        - check plan change policy (immediate, eot)
        - check alignments of new plan with old 
        - check move between pricelists
        - check that phases progress successfully after change
        - check obsolete events are removed
    * Change base plan multiple times
        - check that alignment occurs correctly 
        - check phases progress correctly
        - check obsolete events are removed 
        
    * Cancellation of a single phase plan
        - check creation and timing of termination event
    * Cancellation of a multi-phase plan
        - check creation of termination event 
        - check removal of events beyond termination event
    * Change a cancelled base plan - should fail
    
    * Migration to a single phase plan
        - check migration event occurs when it should
    * Migration to a multi-phase plan
        - check migration event occurs when it should
        - check migration into different phase
        - check alignment of phases can be correctly controlled
    * Migration to a fixed duration plan
        - check migration event occurs when it should
        - check termination event occurs when it should
        

         
STANDALONE TEST
    * Create multiple plans in a single bundle
        - check plans can be created
        - check cannot add a base plan
        - check BCD at subscription bundle level
            

PRICE CHANGE TEST
    * Price change on a single phase base plan
        - check new subscriptions get price after effective date
        - check changed subscriptions get price after effective date
        - check existing subscriptions ONLY get it after ESED
        - check that if ESED is missing existing subs are grandfathered for ever
    * Price change on a multi-phase subscription
        - check price change applies correctly to correct phases
    * Multiple price changes
        - check multiple price changes with overlapping dates


ADD-ON TESTS
    * Add-on creation alignment
    * Add-on cancel with base plan
